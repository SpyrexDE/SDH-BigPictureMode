Plugin for the Steam Deck [homebrew plugin manager](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader) that allows you to switch into and out of Big Picture via the quick access menu.

Surprisingly, Steam's well-known BigPicture mode is out of the box compatible with the Steam Decks gaming mode. It even combines the **best of both worlds**:
- All SD controls work as expected within BP mode
- The Steam button opens the BP mode's game overlay
- The quick access button still opens the new Quick Settings side menu (Only when a game is running)
- Virtual keyboard as well as all the other Steam-button shortcuts are working as well
- Sleep mode still works fine
